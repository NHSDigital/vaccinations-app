## Project Overview

Within the NHS app, vaccinations app will increase the rate of booking by:
- Informing individuals with personalised information about which vaccinations they still need to have and how to book
- Providing information on eligibility and how to book where eligibility is not available
- Providing personalised vaccination availability and booking journeys, based on local availability

We will increase appointment attendance and reduce the number of 'did not attend' and therefore increase appointment availability by:
- Providing people with details of all their upcoming vaccination appointments, with simple, easy options to cancel or change.

## Developer Setup

### GitHub
- As per NHS guidelines, make your GitHub email private by going [here](https://github.com/settings/emails). There is a checkbox named "Keep my email addresses private". Note down your private email from this setting.
- Follow these [instructions](https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/CSP/How+to+access+GitHub).
  - Remember to use your private email, noted above, in GitHub config 'user.email'.
  - When on the step to create personal access tokens, remember to also tick 'workflow'. This will allow developers to update workflows
- Get your NHS GitHub username added to the VitA team to gain access to the repository

### Prerequisites
Tools to install:

From NHS repository template:
- **make** -
  - The version of GNU make available by default on macOS is earlier than 3.82. You will need to upgrade it or certain make tasks will fail.
  On macOS, you will need Homebrew installed, then to install make, like so:
  - ```
    brew install make
    ```
  - Follow instructions in homebrew output to fix your $PATH variable
- **asdf** - version manager with support for multiple languages
  - ```
    brew install asdf
    ```
  - ```
    echo 'export PATH="${HOME}.asdf/shims:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
  - Install nodejs plugin for asdf (and required dependencies)
  - ```
    brew install gpg gawk
    asdf plugin add nodejs https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs.git
    ```
- **Colima** - or any equivalent Docker container runtime, e.g. [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/), etc.

From vaccinations-app specific dependencies
- **Volta** - (todo: required for yarn; remove if not needed) version manager for Node and Yarn. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started)
  - ```
    brew install volta
    ```
  - ```
    echo 'export VOLTA_HOME=${HOME}/.volta' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'export PATH="${VOLTA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
  - ```
    volta install node
    volta install yarn
    ```
- **pre-commit** - (todo: asdf conflict; confirm if this is still required) configure hooks to run automatically before each commit
  - ```
    brew install pre-commit
    ```
- **Talisman** - security scanner preventing secrets and sensitive information from being committed
  - ```
    brew install talisman
    ```
- **Act** - tool to run GitHub actions locally. Usage guide is available [here](https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html)
    - ```
      brew install act
      ```
    - symlink `/var/run/docker.sock` file to your chosen docker container tool's `docker.sock` file location. For e.g. `sudo ln -s /Users/<username>/.colima/default/docker.sock /var/run/docker.sock`
    - after successful installation, when you run act for the first time, it will ask for the size of docker container. Choose 'medium'.
    - to list all available jobs and workflows
      ```
      act --list
      ```
    - to run a specific job ID
      ```
      act -j 'check-english-usage' --defaultbranch main
      ```
    - to run all jobs in a workflow file
      ```
      act -W .github/workflows/cicd-1-pull-request.yaml --defaultbranch main
      ```

### Local Configuration
1. Install toolchain dependencies and load .tool-versions into asdf
  - ```
    make config
    ```
1. Install and setup pre-commit hooks for this project (todo: confirm if this is still needed with make setup)
  - ```
    pre-commit install
    ```
1. Using Yarn package manager, install dependencies from package.json
   - ```
     yarn install
     ```

## Usage

### Build
```
yarn run build
```

### Run service locally
Serves web content from src folder, so make changes and refresh the browser to see changes immediately.
```
yarn run dev
```

### Run unit tests
```
yarn run test
```

### Run pre-commit script manually
```
yarn run pre-commit
```
(Note that this has also been configured as a pre-commit hook that will run automatically before each commit)
