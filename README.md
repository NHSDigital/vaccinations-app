[![CI/CD Pull Request](https://github.com/NHSDigital/vaccinations-app/actions/workflows/cicd-1-pull-request.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NHSDigital/vaccinations-app/actions/workflows/cicd-1-pull-request.yaml)

Within the NHS app, vaccinations app will increase the rate of booking by:
- Informing individuals with personalised information about which vaccinations they still need to have and how to book
- Providing information on eligibility and how to book where eligibility is not available
- Providing personalised vaccination availability and booking journeys, based on local availability

We will increase appointment attendance and reduce the number of 'did not attend' and therefore increase appointment availability by:
- Providing people with details of all their upcoming vaccination appointments, with simple, easy options to cancel or change.

## Setup
- As per NHS guidelines, make your GitHub email private by going [here](https://github.com/settings/emails). There is a checkbox named "Keep my email addresses private". Not down your private email from this setting.
- Follow these [instructions](https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/CSP/How+to+access+GitHub).
  - Remember to use your private email, noted above, in GitHub config 'user.email'.
  - When on the step to create personal access tokens, remember to also tick 'workflow'. This will allow developers to update workflows

### Prerequisites
Tools to install:
- **Volta** - version manager for Node and Yarn. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started)
  - ```
    brew install volta
    ```
  - ```
    echo 'export VOLTA_HOME=${HOME}/.volta' >> ~/.zshrc
    echo 'export PATH="${VOLTA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"' >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
  - ```
    volta install node
    volta install yarn
    ```
- **pre-commit** - configure hooks to run automatically before each commit
  - ```
    brew install pre-commit
    ```
- **Talisman** - security scanner preventing secrets and sensitive information from being committed
  - ```
    brew install talisman
    ```
- **Colima** - or any equivalent Docker container runtime, e.g. [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/), etc.
- **Act** - tool to run GitHub actions locally. Usage guide is available [here](https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html)
    - ```
      brew install act
      ```
    - symlink `/var/run/docker.sock` file to your chosen docker container tool's `docker.sock` file location. For e.g. `sudo ln -s /Users/<username>/.colima/default/docker.sock /var/run/docker.sock`
    - after successful installation, when you run act for the first time, it will ask for the size of docker container. Choose 'medium'.
    - to list all available jobs and workflows
      ```
      act --list
      ```
    - to run a specific job ID
      ```
      act -j 'check-english-usage' --defaultbranch main
      ```
    - to run all jobs in a workflow file
      ```
      act -W .github/workflows/cicd-1-pull-request.yaml --defaultbranch main
      ```

### Configuration
1. Install and setup pre-commit hooks for this project
   - ```
     pre-commit install
     ```
2. Using Yarn package manager, install dependencies from package.json
   - ```
     yarn install
     ```

## Usage
### Build
```
yarn run build
```

### Run service locally
Serves web content from src folder, so make changes and refresh the browser to see changes immediately.
```
yarn run dev
```

### Run pre-commit script manually
