Within the NHS app, vaccinations app will increase the rate of booking by:
- Informing individuals with personalised information about which vaccinations they still need to have and how to book
- Providing information on eligibility and how to book where eligibility is not available
- Providing personalised vaccination availability and booking journeys, based on local availability

We will increase appointment attendance and reduce the number of 'Did not attends and therefore increase appointment availability by:
- Providing people with details of all their upcoming vaccination appointments, with simple, easy options to cancel or change.
